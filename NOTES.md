## AI Usage Disclosure

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools (ChatGPT by OpenAI) in the following ways:

### What AI Was Used For
- **Project Planning:** ChatGPT helped outline the overall folder structure, file organization, and step-by-step development strategy.
- **Code Generation:** Initial scaffolding for Flask endpoints (`shorten`, `redirect`, `analytics`), utility functions (e.g., URL validation, short code generation), and thread-safe in-memory storage logic was generated using ChatGPT.
- **Testing:** Suggested structure and implementation for `pytest` test cases to validate endpoint behavior and error handling.

### What Was Done Manually
- All AI-generated code was **manually reviewed**, **edited**, and **tested**.
- Edge cases, error responses, and thread safety were verified through practical testing.
- Custom refinements were made to ensure proper input validation, clean API responses, and code readability.

### What Was Not Used
- No AI-generated code was used without verification.
- No AI was used for deployment, Dockerization, or GitHub documentation (unless otherwise stated).

### Why AI Was Used
- To accelerate development within the limited time frame.
- To ensure coverage of key requirements with high code quality and clean architecture.

This disclosure is provided to maintain transparency and comply with project guidelines regarding AI-assisted development.
